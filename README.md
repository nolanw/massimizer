# Massy

A quick translator of recipes from volumes to masses.

## Usage

Head over to http://massy.nolanw.ca and type in a recipe!

## Why?

Most of the recipes I come across here in Canada specify ingredient amounts in volumes. Cups of this, tablespoons of that. I like using my kitchen scale, and it measures grams. And looking things up manually in density tables is boring.

## Sources

Ingredient densities come from [aqua-calc][] and [Answers][].
