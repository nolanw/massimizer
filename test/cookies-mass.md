# Chocolate chip cookies

- 227g butter
- 201g granulated sugar
- 110g brown sugar, packed
- 2 eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla
- 344g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 343g semisweet chocolate chips
- 109g chopped walnuts or pecans

In bowl with butter, gradually beat in granulated and brown sugars until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla.

In separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda and salt; stir into butter mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls, about 5 cm apart, onto parchment paper-lined or greased rimless baking sheets. With fork, flatten to 1 cm thickness. Bake in 350ºF (180ºC) oven for 8 to 12 minutes or until edges are golden and centres still slightly underbaked. Let cool on pans on racks for 5 minutes. Transfer to racks; let cool completely. (Make-ahead: layer between waxed paper in airtight container and store at room temperature for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.)
